# handwritten_digit_classification
Predict handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset

## Platform
Google Collab

## Programming Language
Python

## Libraries
Tensorflow, Sklearn, Numpy

## Description / Goals 

The purpose of this project is to predict correctly as many as possible handwritten digits of  MNIST's test set (`t10k-images.idx3-ubyte`). <br>
In order to achieve that we will build a complex Neural Network as follows:

1. Create and train an Autoencoder Neural Œùetwork.
 
2. Create and train a Classifier (Feed-Forward Neural Network), using the encoder part of the Autoencoder.

3. Evaluate the Classifier's accuracy based on the provided labels of the test set (`t10k-labels.idx1-ubyte`).
